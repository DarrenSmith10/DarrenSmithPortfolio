    <p class="aboutPara">This project is based on developing a software algorithm for different devices such as laptops and tablets.
        The software utilises a display that makes sure of photometric stern which uses multiple images from the scene from a fixed viewpoint under different illumination conditions.
        Photometric stereo is 3D reconstruction technique that uses a single camera. It is a effective technique for performing face recognition on systems such as security because it is good at extracting high level features using surface normals and projects the detail using the depth map.
        The project was split into 3 main tasks which were Camera Calibration, Light Calibration and 3D reconstruction. 
        Together this reconstructed the image giving the result shown below.</p>

    <p class="aboutPara">In this project the aim is to build an interactive dashboard to observe and analyze coffee shop sale prices.</p>

        <h3>1. Preparing the Data for Analysis</body></h3>
        <p class="aboutPara"> The coffee shop dataset was observed by checking transactions that were recorded over a period of time. 
        Also the number of products and Categories sold was noted. Afterwards a new column was added to calculate Revenue. 
        Additionally the Month, Day of Week and Hours were added.</p>
        
        
        <h3>2. Explore the Data using Pivot Tables</h3>
        
        <p class="aboutPara"> The next task was to create a pivot table that allow the data to be sliced for simplicity. 
        With data organized in a table it is ready to be used in the dashboard.</p>
        
        
        <h3>3. Create the Dashboard</h3>
        
        <p class="aboutPara"> The final step was to create a dashboard to visualize the data. First step was to create Pivot charts to show the Total Revenue by Month, Transactions by Day of the Week, Transactions by Hour of day and Transactions by Product Category. 
        The charts are assembled into a rough dashboard format and contains a table showing the top 15 products types.
        
        A slicer was added for store location location which allows the data and visualization to be updated for each location. 
        From the end result patterns and trends can be observed.</p>
